# Hi, I’m Laura 👋

I study and build **reliable machine learning systems** — with interests spanning **learning theory & optimization**, **evaluation/calibration**, **conditional compute**, and **scientific ML**. I like problems where rigor meets engineering: clean objectives, tight measurements, and runnable artifacts.

- 🎓 **Stanford BS/MS ’27, CS (AI track)** — coursework in ML theory, CV/DL, NLP, self-improving agents, linear & convex systems.
- 🧪 Research: **Microsoft Research (AI Interaction & Learning)**, **Stanford Scaling Intelligence Lab**; prior applied ML in **drug discovery** and **edge/streaming systems**.
- 🔬 Interests: controllable/model editing, calibration/uncertainty, safe RL, and adaptive inference.

## 🔬 Research Highlights
- **Evaluation for agentic systems** — policy families, ablations, and uncertainty-aware scoring with expert-in-the-loop review.
- **Controllable model editing** — task-vector approaches to adjust behavior trade-offs (fairness/alignment vs. accuracy).
- **Attribution drift & OOD** — studying shifts in saliency/attention as early signals for distribution change.

**Toolbox:** PyTorch · Hugging Face · ONNX Runtime · scikit-learn · Python · (some) C/C++ · JS/TS
